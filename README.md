- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelrossoni-toast
- 👀 I’m interested in helping _YOU_ make your code more secure! I really enjoy software development and building the right solutions for problems that
don't exist yet. I enjoy gaming of all kinds, spening time outdoors, coaching softball and baseball, and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and secure design patterns around kotlin
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on threat models for your application, system architectures, microservices, and other non-front-end things.
- 📫 michael.rossoni@toasttab.com or on slack!
